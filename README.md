# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application for Angular JS

This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application. It is based on the PluralSight course Angular Fundamentals.

### Server

We are using a node server to display this angular application so running server.sh (or server.bat if on a windows machine) with the correct permissions and node installed will allow you to view this project.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser. You may have to add the page to the url such as EventDetails.html depending on where you are at in the course. The configuration for the server is found in the webserver.js file.
